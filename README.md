### Additional Notes
- **Package Notes**: If `groq` or any other package requires specific versions of Python or has dependencies that need manual installation, include those details in the installation instructions.
- **Virtual Environment**: It might be a good idea to recommend the use of a virtual environment (`venv`) to avoid conflicts with other Python packages installed globally:
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
  pip install yt-dlp
  pip install groq
  ```
- **Custom Repositories**: If `groq` needs to be installed from a custom Python package index, you might need to specify it using `pip install --index-url [URL] groq`.
